Client-Server Architecture :-  The application follows a client-server model where one machine acts as the server, managing connections and message distribution, while multiple clients connect to the server to send and receive messages.

User Authentication :-  Users may need to authenticate themselves before joining the chat. This could involve a simple username/password mechanism or integration with an external authentication service.

Real-Time Messaging :-  The application provides real-time messaging functionality, allowing users to send text messages instantly to other connected users.

Group Chat :-  Users can participate in group conversations where messages are broadcasted to all members of the group.

Networking:-
Communication between the server and clients is facilitated through IP sockets, ensuring reliable data transfer over the network.


GUI Development:-
Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) makes a more user-friendly chat experience.
